# Music For Windows

Music For Windows was an (electron) app made to port the Apple Music App to Windows at a time where it didn't exist.

This project is now quite old but should work approximatelly right, if configured properly. It is not finished but once an Apple Music account connected, everything should work pretty well.

### Features
- Every basic music player controls, however song queue management may be inacurate
- Full sync with the account
- Listen Now & Browse Apple Music pages
- Dark Mode
- Apple Music search and *not* Library search

### Apple Music API

At the time I was not able to use the Apple Music API (if it existed/was public) so the app was basically having a tiny music.apple.com wrapper in the background so that I am able to use the Apple Music API.
